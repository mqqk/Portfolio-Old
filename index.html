			<p class="box">I am entering a new and interesting world of computer code and exploration. For the last 14 years I committed myself to public service but in light of recent events, decided a new direction in my life was needed. It is with a heavy heart I made this decision. I enrolled in the Thinkful course officially on July 1st, 2020, and have thoroughly enjoyed the curriculum. It is challenging and interesting. Each day I think about what I could do next to expand my skillset and challange myself.</p>

			<p class="box">I graduated from highschool in 2000 and obtained a degree in Philosophy from NC State. Naturally, I utilized this degree in a career in law enforcement. I kid. My education contributed to my ability to think critically and try to maintain objectivity. This was useful in my career as a law enforcement officer.</p>
			<p class="box">I joined the Raleigh Police Department in July of 2006. Despite popular belief, training is long and arduous. My training began that July and did not finish until August 2007. Even then, I received guidance from senior leadership and supervisors. I did not feel mostly adept at my job for at least 5 years at which point I felt my skills and determination to excel blossom. I spent the next 9 years constantly training, self-criticizing, and improving.

			<p class="box">Family used to mean, where I came from and the people with whom I grew up. That changed at some point to and family means something completely different to me now. The bedrock of my family is the love I share with my beautiful wife, Mary. She has helped me become the person I am today. I am not sure what I would have been without her, but I feel reasonably sure I am better person for having her in my life and I would not change a thing. In 2012 and 2015, we added to our family with two boys, Elijah and Eric, respectively. We are very happy.</p>
